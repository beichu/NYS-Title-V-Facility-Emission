# Title V Emissions Data Analysis and Visualization (New York State)

## Overview

This project presents analysis of air pollutant emissions from Title V facilities across New York State. Title V facilities are major sources of air pollution regulated under the U.S. Clean Air Act. The analysis includes facility-level mapping, pollutant summary statistics, and a focused investigation into Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), which pose significant risks to human health.

## Key Features

- **Facility Mapping**: Visualizes the locations of 477 Title V facilities.
- **Pollutant Summary**: Provides cumulative totals, annual range, mean and median for nine regulated pollutants.
- **Trend Analysis**: Applies Mann-Kendall test to assess statistical significance of HAPs emission trends over time.
- **Sector Breakdown**: Identifies top-emitting industry sectors using SIC codes.
- **Facility-Level Emissions**: Highlights HAPs emission level at individual sites, revealing high emitters.
